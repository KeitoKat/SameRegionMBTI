# SameRegionMBTI (Summary)
Does where you live have any correlation to your Myers Briggs personality type (MBTI)?

## Inspiration
This project takes inspiration from "geopsychology," an evolving field of the study of human behavior.
The aim is to observe any apparent pattern of the MBTI across bordering regions. For example, the scope of the observations can be as broad as the continent of Asia or as narrow as countries in Southeast Asia only.

The project hope to answer: *Does where you live have any correlation to your personality type?*

## Processing the data
The provided dataset classified MBTI into subgroup of assertive and turbulent which are not very important in this study. Therefore, the subtypes were combined into one main type, such that INTJ-A and INTJ-T is just INTJ.

Since the interest of this study relates back to the broader regions, a new column is created to classify each country into their appropriate continents.

## Visualization
Bright colors are used to assist users in identifying the different personality types. A "column chart" is appropriate for showing which BMTI is the most prominent.
A "card" and "map" were used to assist users in the visualization aspect.


## Conclusion
Depending on which region is being observed, there seems to be some correlations between a popular MBTI and the region it is in.
In the example of Southeast Asia, INFP happens to be the most common type in the region, with the exception of only one country.


## What's next?
This study can dive deeper into the factors that influences the personality type(s) of a region, whether it is geographically or cultural. It can also look into the relationship between personality types and purchasing behaviors, values, or work ethics, to name a few.

## Potential application
- Adding value to the study of demographic trends
- Adding value to the study of history and culture
- Used by students looking study abroad
- Further industry market research
- And more...
