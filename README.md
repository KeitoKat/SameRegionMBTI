# SameRegionMBTI (Summary)
Does where you live have any correlation to your Myers Briggs personality type (MBTI)?

## Inspiration
This project takes inspiration from "geopsychology" (Ref 1.) an evolving field of the study of human behavior.
The aim is to observe any apparent pattern of the MBTI across bordering regions. For example, the scope of the observations can be as broad as the continent of Asia or as narrow as countries in Southeast Asia only.

The project hopes to answer: *Does where you live have any correlation to your personality type?*

## Processing the data
The provided dataset (Ref 2.) classified the MBTI into two subgroups: assertive and turbulent, which are not very important in this study. Therefore, the subtypes were combined into one main type, such that INTJ-A and INTJ-T are just INTJ.

Because the study's focus is on the larger regions, a new column is added to classify each country into its appropriate continent. 

## Visualization
Bright colors are used to distinguish between personality types.
A "column chart" is appropriate for demonstrating the trend of which BMTI is most popular in a specific region.
The "card" and "map" features were used to provide a quick summary of the region's predominant BMTI based on the user's countries of interest. For example, the users can select only SouthEast Asian countries within Asia.


## Conclusion
There appears to be a high correlation between a popular MBTI and the region it is in, depending on which region is observed.
In the example of Southeast Asia, INFP happens to be the most common personality type in the region, with the exception of Laos.


## What's next?
This study can dive deeper into the factors that influence the personality types of a region, whether it is geographically or culturally based. It can also look into the relationship between personality types and purchasing behaviors, values, or work ethics, to name a few.

## Potential application
- Adding value to the study of demographic trends
- Adding value to the study of history and culture
- Used by students who are looking to study abroad
- Further industry market research
And more.
